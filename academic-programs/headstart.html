The Headstart Program for the Gifted and Talented Preschoolers in Public Elementary Schools is a preparatory program for 4-5 years old children who manifest superior intelligence beyond their chronological age. The program provides appropriate educational services, train teachers, administrators and supervisors on the early identification of gifted and talented preschoolers, and develops an enriched curriculum that nurtures, challenges and hones the multiple intelligences of these children, imbued with desirable values.

The main goal of the program is to ensure that all gifted and talented preschoolers are given the necessary support to attain the highest standard of achievement that matches with their abilities, intelligence and skills. Specifically, the program aims to:
-	offer the services for the mastery of the basic skills and development/enhancement of the multiple intelligences at a pace and depth appropriate to the capabilities of the gifted and talented preschoolers;
-	provide an environment that encourages and challenges the gifted preschoolers in the development of creativity, originality, fluency, flexibility and elaboration in their thought processes; and
-	provide opportunities for the gifted/talented preschoolers to explore and develop their unique abilities.
