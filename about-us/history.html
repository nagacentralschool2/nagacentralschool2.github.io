<img src="/assets/img/ncs2_facade.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded d-block mx-auto" alt="School Facade">

Naga Central School II was originally a part of the Naga Central School which was founded in 1911.
It is located along Jacob St. in Barangay Pe√±afrancia, Naga City, standing on a twenty thousand
(20,000) square meter lot originally owned by the Provincial Government of Camarines Sur and was
donated due to upsurge in enrolment of the then Naga Central School. This huge enrolment resulted
to its division in 1988 to two central schools: Naga Central School I and Naga Central School II.
The two schools were established by virtue of a city charter amidst pressure and conflicts to cater
the need of the poor and average-income families of Naga City and the nearby towns of Camarines Sur.

From the time that this school was established, numerous school heads have been instrumental
to its development and continuing progress, namely; Violeta S. Del Villar, Ph.D (1989-1991),
Lillia A. Ragrario (1991-1993), Francia D. Oporto (1993-1996), Cecilia G. Ledesma (1996-1998),
Domingo O. Balares, Ph.D (1998-2003), Pablo P. Marpuri, Jr. (2003-2006), Teresita Irma S. Dy-Cok,
Ph.D (2006-2008), Antonio A. Baloro (1998-2011), Francisco Leo J. Damasig (2011-2013),
Frederick M. Baldoza (2013-2019) and Juliet C. Curva, Ph.D, the present principal.

Now, Naga Central School II is one of the most populous public schools in Naga City offering
three curricula to address the various learning needs of the constituents:
Special Science Elementary School (SSES), Headstart Program for the Gifted and K to 12.
