## The DepEd Vision

We dream of Filipinos  
who passionately love their country  
and whose values and competencies  
enable them to realize their full potential  
and contribute meaningfully to building the nation.

As a learner-centered public institution,  
the Department of Education  
continuously improves itself  
to better serve its stakeholders.
