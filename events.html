#### Events

{% comment %} 
	We put the events as they appear in the events.yml file.
	To order the other way around, we should be able to use the "reverse" filter,
	but it doesn't seem to work:
	{% assign sortedItems = site.events | reverse %}
{% endcomment %}

{% include list.html items=site.events %}
